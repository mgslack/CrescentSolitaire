      <p>Crescent solitaire is played with two decks of standard playing cards. At the beginning of the game,
	    the cards are dealt out into sixteen (16) piles with the first ace and king of each suit dealt out to eight
		(8) foundation stacks. Each pile will contain six (6) cards at the beginning of the game. The card piles are
		usually laid out in a crescent pattern around the foundations, hence the name of the game. The top card of each
		pile is dealt face up so the player can see the card.</p>
	  <p>Play commences with the player moving cards from the piles to the foundations by suit in order. Cards are
	    played onto the foundations from King to Ace or from Ace to King. Once a card is played unto a foundation
		stack, it cannot be moved off except to the opposite foundation stack. Cards can be played either up or
		down from one pile to another. Kings wrap around to Ace or an Ace can wrap around to King when moved from one
		pile to another. Play continues until no cards can be moved from pile to pile or to the foundations. The
		game is won if all cards are moved to the foundation stacks.</p>
	  <p>If no cards can be moved around the piles or unto the foundations, the player is allowed to 'shuffle' the
	    pile card stacks up to three (3) times. Once the piles have been shuffled three times and no cards can be
		played, the game is over (lost). Note, typically, the pile shuffles only consist of moving the bottom card of
		each pile to the top of the pile, leaving the other cards in the same order. There is an option to actually
		shuffle the cards in each pile if selected.</p>
	  <p>Each card added to one of the foundation stacks is worth one point. The point is only added for the first
	    time the card is added to a foundation. If a foundation stack is completed (Ace to King or King to Ace),
		three points are added to the current game score. If the game is won (all foundation stacks are complete),
        a bonus is added to the final score depending on the number of shuffles left. Each shuffle left over is
        worth ten (10) bonus points for a bonus score up to thirty (30) points. A winning game is worth between 120
        points up to a maximum of 150 points.</p>
      <p>An 'undo' button is available to move back cards played from piles or foundations. Cards can be undone with
        the 'undo' button back to the first move made, but only during the current shuffle or game start. Once a
        shuffle is done, then the 'undo' is reset and is available for moves done after the shuffle.

	  <p>Options:<br>
       There are several options that effect game play available to the player. The player can select the way the
	   piles are shuffled, either move the bottom card to top (the default) or shuffle the piles in random order.
	   The player can choose to hide the card under the top card so they can't peek at it (displays either the
	   chosen card back image or the empty pile image if the top card is moved off). The default is to show the card
	   under the top card if the top card is moved. In addition, the player can choose the image used for the backs
	   of the cards when needed.</p>

The Crescent Solitaire game

Game written after playing a version of the game on a Amazon Fire tablet.  Wanted to play
on my Windows PC, so created my own version.

Plays a decent version of the Crescent Solitaire game (2 deck solitaire card game).  Game is
dependent on both the PlayingCards and GameStatistics assembly libraries.  Both are needed
to edit or compile in VS.
Game was last modified in VS 2019.
